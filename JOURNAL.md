**Total Time: 3.5 hours**     

**Day 1: July 1**    
Today I started by researching how to make a 2 axis robot. I looked into how 3D printers work, and realized a linear steel rod with a linear ball bearing works best and is the cheapest. With this, I started to make an onshape model. One problem I had was how to use special elements, like aluminum t-slots or ball bearings in my CAD. After doing some research, I learned I could link these models into my CAD, making it much easier to use special parts in my 3D model. I imported the bearing and aluminum tubes and then measured my air hockey table to find I need a frame 40 in by 36 in. However, I could not find an aluminum t-slot that long, so I traced the face sketch and extruded it to extend it. I edited the imported part to fit my requirments. I also made 3D printable brackets to attach to the aluminum tubes and hold the bearings. I was able to make the basic movement frame, and added mates and limits to simulate how it would move. I also added the grove to the main slider in order to be able to add multiple attachments to the frame. One problem I faced was that the horizontal length was slightly less than 36 in (35.66in), and it would be easier if the horizontal and vertical bars were the same. I spend some time changing dimensions to make room for the extra 0.44 inches. I also used a variable for the bolt, rod, and bearing diameter in case I can't find the exact dimensions I modelled. Overall, I was able to make the base to see how the robot would move (without any motors), and added variables to make easy changes later.        
Note: I could not find the original creator of the aluminum tube and bearing, but the STEP files are in the onshape project (unsure if I used someone else's CAD or a linked CAD, since could not find name of owner or original document) (Not trying to steal credit or work, just no citations given by onshape about the model I imported)
